        <p>
          The Life Choices Academy is a full-time program which empowers youth from the Cape Flats with life, practical and professional development skills. We did intensive study of the following web development languages: HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript and Sass. As part of our professional development, we had the opportunity to use online resources such as MOOCs, were taught Design Thinking and made use of resources for personal reflection, such as DISC profiles and SMART goal setting. I naturally possess the ability to link new knowledge to new ways of being creative, however, this course has trained me to ensure that creativity and form do not block function and results in my work.
